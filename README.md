plugbotReloaded
===============

A Fork of the well known plug.dj plugin plugBot



CREDITS :

My first project in javascript. Based on the well known plug.dj extension "plugBot" by Connergdavis (https://github.com/connergdavis/Plugbot)


The First version is now working !


When you start the bot, a status message will appear in the chat telling the current status of the AutoWoot and the AutoQueue.


The slash command mentionned in the status message is currently not working.
The AutoQueue function is currently not working.



How to use?

1. Create a bookmark button and paste this code inside the "Address" field.
2. It will automatically get the latest version updated to github of the plugbotReloaded bot when updated.


javascript:%20(function%20(){var%20jsCode%20=%20document.createElement('script');%20jsCode.setAttribute('id',%20'plugbotReloaded-js');%20jsCode.setAttribute('src',%20'https://raw.github.com/murohman/plugbotReloaded/master/plugbotReloaded.js');%20document.body.appendChild(jsCode);%20}());



My plans for the future

1. Get the AutoQueue function to work properly.
2. Get the slash commands working.
3. Maybe add a couple other functions wich were available from the old plugbot such as the auto-skip and hide video functions
